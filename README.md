# 🧮 Calculator Project

A basic on-screen calculator built with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.

This project is part of the [Foundations Course](https://www.theodinproject.com/) from The Odin Project and is designed to reinforce key programming concepts including functions, DOM manipulation, and event handling.

---

## 📌 Project Objectives

- Create a simple calculator that performs basic arithmetic operations.
- Practice JavaScript logic, HTML structure, and CSS layout.
- Build clean UI interactions using DOM updates and event listeners.

---

## ✅ Features to Implement

- [ ] Addition
- [ ] Subtraction
- [ ] Multiplication
- [ ] Division
- [ ] Operate function that selects the correct operation
- [ ] Buttons for digits (0–9), operators, equals (`=`), and clear
- [ ] Display area for user input and results

---

## 🧠 Development Steps

### Phase 1: JavaScript Logic

- [ ] Create arithmetic functions for each operation
- [ ] Set up variables for input numbers and selected operator
- [ ] Create a general `operate()` function that performs the operation

### Phase 2: HTML Layout

- [ ] Design the calculator interface using HTML
- [ ] Add buttons for all digits, operators, equals, and clear
- [ ] Add a display area at the top

### Phase 3: Interactivity

- [ ] Add event listeners to digit buttons to update the display
- [ ] Capture the first number and operator when an operator is clicked
- [ ] Capture the second number when `=` is clicked and show the result
- [ ] Implement the clear button to reset all data

### Phase 4: Error Handling and UX

- [ ] Prevent multiple operations being evaluated at once
- [ ] Round long decimals to avoid overflow
- [ ] Handle missing input cases
- [ ] Prevent divide-by-zero errors and show a custom message
- [ ] Reset display correctly after showing results

---

## 🌟 Optional Features

- [ ] Add support for decimal input
- [ ] Add a backspace/delete button
- [ ] Add keyboard support for input and operation

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Open `index.html` in a browser.
3. Interact with the calculator or use the browser console to test functionality.
